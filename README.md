Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to yhe development and maintenance of high level software systems.
Software engineering is important to the technology industry as it enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The development of programming language.
The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s.
The advent of structured programming in the 1970s.
The rise of agule methodologies in the 2000s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements: gathering and documentation of user needs and system requirements 
Design: creating high level and detailed design of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation: writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
Testing: conducting various tests to ensure the software meets the quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment: releasing the software to users or customers.
Maintenance: providing ongoing support, updates and enhancement to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Agile: Best for projects requiring flexibility and frequent feedback, such as software development.
Waterfall: Best for projects with fixed, well-understood requirements and a need for a structured approach, such as construction projects

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer: writes code and implements software solutions.
Quality assurance engineer: ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project manager: oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs: they are comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code an example is visual code.
VCS: they track changes to source code and help coordinate work among team members an example is git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
CHALLENGES 
Changing requirements.
Tight deadlines 
Technical debts
STRATEGIES FOR THE CHALLENGES 
Effective communication between teamm members and  the clients 
Use of agile methodologies 
Prioritization of tasks
Regular reassessment of project goals and timelines 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing: testing individual components or modules of the software.
Integration testing: testing interaction between different components or sub systems.
System testing: testing the entire software as a whole.
Acceptance testing: testing the software against the user requirements to ensure it meets the user needs.
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
It involves the crafting of questions or statements to get the best possible response from AI models. They are important as the help the AI models better understand whats is asked of the thus giving the best possible response.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vauge promt: Write a story 
Improved promt: Write a story about a boy who did not value education but later comes to learn the importance of education.
The improved promt is more effective since it gives the exact kind of story that the user needs. It constrains the AI model to a given context preventing it from straying out of topic therefore giving the best possible story within the given context.
